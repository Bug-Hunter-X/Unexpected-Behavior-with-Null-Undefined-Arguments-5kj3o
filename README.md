# Unexpected Behavior with Null/Undefined Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to unexpected behavior when null or undefined values are passed as arguments to a function.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function does not explicitly handle null or undefined values for its arguments (`a` and `b`). This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially if the function relies on the properties or methods of these arguments within its internal logic.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks for null or undefined values at the beginning of the function and handling these cases appropriately. This prevents unexpected errors and improves the robustness of the code.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `bug.js` file using a JavaScript environment such as Node.js.
4. Observe that the `foo` function does not behave as expected when null or undefined is used as an argument.
5. Run the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected function that explicitly handles such cases.
